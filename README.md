Mahabhrata translated...

Original English: "In this world, when it was destitute of brightness and light, and enveloped all around in total darkness, there came into being, as the primal cause of creation, a mighty egg..."

Monty Python Style: "Right, so picture this: Complete darkness. Nothing. Nada. Not even a small table lamp. And then - wait for it - an EGG appears! Yes, an egg! The entire bloody universe started with an egg! I suppose someone should have asked, 'But where did the chicken come from then?' But no, we're just meant to accept it. A cosmic egg. Probably a size 12 or something ridiculous. Free range, one hopes."
